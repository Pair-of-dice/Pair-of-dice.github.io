It's been some time since I worked on a personal project. I've been mainly
focusing my efforts on college however, now that the first semester is nearly
over I've realised I had a lot more time to my myself than I had expected.

Because of this, I've decided to start a new project I'm calling "Astronaut
Reader". It's a TUI RSS reader using Ncurses similar to
[Canto](https://codezen.org/canto-ng/) and
[Bulletty](https://github.com/CrociDB/bulletty). I'm currently just
experimenting with the curses library for
Lua [lcurses](https://github.com/lcurses/lcurses). The Codeberg repository is
located [here](https://codeberg.org/ParadiseOfMagic/Astronaut-reader).

This isn't my first project, I had made a very insecure password manager in
Python last year called
[Kain](https://bitbucket.org/paradiseofmemory/kainpasswordmanager/src/main/).
While it's not very practical due to it storing things in plain text, it did
teach me some Git and Python.
